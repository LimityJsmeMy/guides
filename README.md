Limity jsme my Software Project Guides
======================================

This is a collection of documents describing how we approach projects whose result is software. It′s not exhaustive nor complete, but it′s a start and a point of reference. If you want to help us, it may be better to meet us in person (perhaps on one of our open plenaries).
